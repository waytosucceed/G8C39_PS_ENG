            "is carried out"
          ],
          "answer": 2,
          "explanation": "In the simple present passive, the structure is 'am/is/are + past participle.' The subject 'calculations' is plural, so we use 'are.' The correct passive construction here is 'are being carried out,' since it suggests an ongoing process typical of tasks that are systematically done using software."

          "explanation": "In the simple past passive, the structure is 'was/were + past participle.' Since 'documents' is plural, 'were' is used. The correct past participle of 'submit' is 'submitted.' Option d) 'weren't submitted' is correct because it directly states that the action did not occur."
